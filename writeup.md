I am a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, working with Aditya Kanade and Sriram Rajamani on AI4Code. 
My current research is on using language models together with program analysis to reason and automate complex software engineering tasks.
Check out our most recent work in this direction: CodePlan.

Previously, I worked with Florian Shkurti at the University of Toronto on learning based approaches into task and motion planning for robotics.
As an undergraduate student at BITS Pilani Goa, I was affiliated with APPCAIR where I worked with Prof. Ashwin Srinivasan and Dr Gautam Shroff on neuro-symbolic approaches to visual reasoning.
