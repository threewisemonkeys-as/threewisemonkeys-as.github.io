[[MATERIAL](https://github.com/ERC-BPGC/cte-archive/tree/master/Sem2_19-20)] I was a mentor for the Intermediate Robotics course conducted by the [Centre for Technical Education](https://bpgc-cte.org/) and [Electroincs and Robotics Club](http://erc-bpgc.github.io/) in 2019-2020. I guided students in motion planning and automation of robots and evaluated assignments.
