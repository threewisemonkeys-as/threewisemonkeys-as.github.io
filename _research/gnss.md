Worked on developing deep learning methods to forecast Total Electron Content (TEC) in the ionosphere and predict scitilation in in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals at [Digital Communication Lab, BITS Pilani, Goa](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/Electrical/dcl).

Also explored gradient boosting machine learning models to classify interference in GNSS signals.
