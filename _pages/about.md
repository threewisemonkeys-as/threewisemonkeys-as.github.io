I am an udergraduate student at the Computer Science Department at [BITS Pilani, Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/), interested in Artificial Intelligence, specifically in the areas of deep learning, **reinforcement learning** and their applications in **robotics**. I am also exploring how RL algorithms can be made more generalizable through human learning priors such as [causality](https://github.com/threewisemonkeys-as/causal-rl), [relational biases](https://github.com/threewisemonkeys-as/relational-rl) and meta learning.

Previously, I have worked on using Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms for robotics as a research intern at the [Center of Robotics and Machine Intelligence](https://robita.iiita.ac.in/), IIIT Allahbad. I have also worked as a summer intern at [CSIR - CEERI](https://www.ceeri.res.in/) on the applications of Deep RL for navigation in aerial vehicals.

I am currently the Coordinator for the [Electronics and Robotics Club](http://erc-bpgc.github.io/) and a Core Member of the [Society of Deep Learning and AI](https://www.saidl.in/) at BITS Goa and have been involved in various student projects.

A collection of my [research](../research) and [projects](../projects) can be viewed on this site along with my [CV](../files/Atharv_Sonwane_CV.pdf).
