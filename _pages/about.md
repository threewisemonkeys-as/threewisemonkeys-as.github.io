I am an udergraduate student at the Computer Science Department at [BITS Pilani, Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/). I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, specifically in the areas of deep learning, reinforcement learning and their applications in robotics. I am also exploring RL algorithms can be made more generalizable through human learning priors such as Causality, Relational biases and meta learning.

Currently, I am working on using Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms for robotic grasping as a research intern at the [IIIT Allahbad Robotics Lab](https://robita.iiita.ac.in/). I have previously worked as a summer intern at [CSIR - CEERI](https://www.ceeri.res.in/) on the applications of Deep RL for navigation in aerial vehicals. I am also the coordinator of the [Electronics and Robotics Club](http://erc-bpgc.github.io/) at BITS Goa and have been involved in various student robotics projects.

A collection of my projects can be viewed [here](../projects/) along with my [CV](../files/Atharv_Sonwane_CV.pdf).
