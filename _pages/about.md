I am an final year undergraduate student at the Computer Science Department at [BITS Pilani, Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/), interested in Artificial Intelligence, specifically in the areas of **meta learning**, **reinforcement learning**, **neurosymbolic AI** and **robotics**. I am also exploring how learning algorithms can be made more generalizable through human learning priors such as [causality](https://github.com/threewisemonkeys-as/causal-rl), [relational biases](https://github.com/threewisemonkeys-as/relational-rl) and [meta learning](https://github.com/threewisemonkeys-as/causal-meta-rl).

Currently I am working remotely with [Dr Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) at the University of Toronto on integrating learning based approaches into task and motion planning for robotics. At BITS, I was affiliated with [APPCAIR](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/APPCAiR) working on Bayesian Neural Program Synthesis and its application to visual reasoning under the supervision of [Prof. Ashwin Srinivasan](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ashwin/profile). I also spent a summer with [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/tcs-research) supervised by Dr Gautam Shroff, exploring neural algorithmic approaches to analogical reasoning.

I am the current President of the [Society for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning](https://www.saidl.in) and was previously the Student Coordinator for the [Electronics and Robotics Club](http://erc-bpgc.github.io/) and have been involved in various student projects at BITS Pilani, Goa.

My [CV](../files/Atharv_Sonwane_CV.pdf) along with a collection of my [research](../research) and [projects](../projects) can be viewed on this site.
