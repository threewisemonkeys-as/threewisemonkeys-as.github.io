Applied Deep Q learning to navigation of autonomous quadcopters. The depthmap from a depthcam was taken as input to generate movement commands for a quadcopter. Along with implementation of the reinforcemnt learning algorithm, this project involved building a controller on top of the MAVROS framework and simulating using PX4 and PX4 SITL.

Both the controller and a gym environment for drone training can be found in this github [repository](https://github.com/threewisemonkeys-as/drone_automation).
