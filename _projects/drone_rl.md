[[CODE](https://github.com/threewisemonkeys-as/drone_automation)] Applied Deep Q learning to navigation of autonomous quadcopters. The depthmap from a depthcam was taken as input to generate movement commands for a quadcopter. Along with implementation of the reinforcemnt learning algorithm, this project involved building a controller on top of the MAVROS framework and simulating using PX4 and PX4 SITL. This project was completed while working as a research intern at [CSIR - CEERI](https://www.ceeri.res.in/).
