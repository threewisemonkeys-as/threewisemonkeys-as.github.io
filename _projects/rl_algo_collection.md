As part of my interest in Deep Reinforcement Learning, I have explored and implemented algorithms proposed in various research papers to get a better understanding of the field.

- RL with Causal Factors ([link](https://github.com/threewisemonkeys-as/causal-rl))
- RL using Relational Inductive Biases ([link](https://github.com/threewisemonkeys-as/relational-rl))
- Scalable Distributed Deep RL ([link](https://github.com/threewisemonkeys-as/torched_impala))
- Various popular algorithms such as SAC, DDPG, TD3, PPO etc. ([link](https://github.com/threewisemonkeys-as/myrl))

The drawbacks of current state of the art Deep RL algorithms are that they are highly sample inefficient and do not generalize well to new tasks. While learnign more about the field, I am exploring how we incorporate human learning priors into RL through Causality, Relational biases, meta learning and heirearchical RL.
