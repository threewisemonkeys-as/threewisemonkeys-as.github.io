[[CODE](https://github.com/ERC-BPGC/Trotbot)] Trotbot is a autonmous ground based robot designed to navigate in an indoor environment. Given a set of waypoints, Trotbot will sequential travel to each point while dynamically avoiding obstacles in its environment.

As part of the project I worked on implementing probabilisitic path planning algorithms in a ROS based navigation stack. The project also involved interfacing sensors such as an optical mouse, RPLIDAR and Intel Realsense D435i for localisation and obstacle detection. I am the project lead for 2020-2021 and we plan to develop Trotbot as a research platform for various ground based navigation techniques.
